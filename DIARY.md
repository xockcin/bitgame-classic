Step 1 - Sandbox - is complete

Next things I do should be:
-refactor buttons so that they are an array.map() situation
-proceed onto step 2, which is Game

addendum: button refactor is done
addendum: proceeded to step 2!

There is now and origin and a goal. It doesn't keep track of your steps and it doesn't tell you when you win. Those, probably latter then former, will be next steps. A few notes:

When-you-win is tricky because bytes are all initialized to zero, which looks like a win, and I am hesitant to initialize them to a random number. But maybe I just should and if it causes a problem I can deal with it later.

Keep-track-of-steps should be easy. But now I need to stop.
